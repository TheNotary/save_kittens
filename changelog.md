    * Do I get extra points for setting up nginx/ thin on the test machine?
    * Am I typically going to be building front end stuff rapidly?
    * Should I handle mailings too?

  - Show off by using Faye instead of polling =D
  - Handle the thank_you as a modal
  - Validations: email, zipcode
  - Validate uniqueness of email, change thankyou to "You already signed successfully."
  - Signing should be an ajax function


Currently:

  - Add some functional tests



Finished:

  - BUG:  pluralization of "the top 2 most committed state is"
  - BUG: emergency fixed the thank_you to render a tiny bit nicer, though should become a modal I think...
  - Hide the /signatures link since wasn't requested
  - Signature Form: name, email, subscribe to our list, and zip code, state
  - Stats for page counter:  Show top 3 states contributing signatures
  - refresh stats every 2 seconds
  - Landing page HTML
